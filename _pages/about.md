### About

Hello there, we are MovieCast.
We consist of a small group of people, pasionated about programming and entertainment. We started this project because we wanted to give people a way to watch their favourite movies whenever they want, wherever that want, for free!

#### ItsDizzy
The brain and founder of our team, always working on something new, he's our leading programmer and is doing the most work by far!
He professions in AngularJS and Node.JS and is currently working at the backend all on his own!

#### Grey
Our lead web designer and front end developer, mostly spends his time either writing stylesheets, cool javascript visuals or translating articles because ItsDizzy sucks at English (jk wuv you Dizzy <3).
He loves experimenting  with new looks and boops noses :3.
